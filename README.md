**CLoD - Pim : Counter based Lookup in DRAM**

CLoD-Pim is a novel micro-architecture based design idea that is inspired from Processing in Memory Paradigms along with an effort to have minimal amount of row activations as a method to save energy and minimise Row Hammer attacks. 
CLoD architecture is developed based on the lookup based processing in memory paradigms along with the involvement of careful row activations in the DRAM to enable efficiency in the lookup process.
